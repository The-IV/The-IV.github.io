        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
        TipTrack (“the App”) is a lightweight personal finance and earnings tracker designed
        to store your income and expense information locally on your device. TipTrack does not
        collect, transmit, or share any personal data to us or to third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information, analytics, advertising data,
        or usage telemetry. All data you enter (earnings, expenses, categories, settings, etc.)
        remains stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
        The app does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or remote data storage.
        No user data is shared with any external services.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Storage</strong></h3>
        <p>
        All records and settings are saved to your device’s local storage. Because data is local,
        you remain in full control — deleting the app will remove the locally stored data.
        If you want to back up your data, please do so using standard device-level backup tools.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
        While TipTrack keeps data on-device, you should follow standard device security practices
        (passcode, device encryption, iCloud backup settings) to protect your information.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>
        If the app’s data practices change in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated.
        We will indicate the new effective date at the top of this page.
        </p>
